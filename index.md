Welcome to OTI's graphical assets library. Use the menu to browser for assets you wish to utilize.

# Naming Conventions and Categories

To manage OTI’s graphic assets, a Github repository will be used, and a web front-end will dynamically display the contents of that repository. All of the assets created for OTI’s projects will be stored here, for universal access and sharing.

# Types of files

If possible, vector graphics in an open format such as Scalable Vector Graphics (.svg files) should be used. When bitmaps are necessary, a low-compression Portable Network Graphics (.png files) should be used.

# Licensing

Graphic elements should be licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.

# Naming convention

Graphic assets should be named in a simple but descriptive manner. For instance, a file containing images of trees would be named something like “Trees.svg”. When there are groups or multiples of images, a type or number can be appended to the name, such as “Router_omnidirectional_01.svg”, “Router_directional_01.svg”, and “Router_directional_02.svg”.
